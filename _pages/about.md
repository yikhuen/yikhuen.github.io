I am Yi Khuen, a first-year Computer Science and Quantitative Finance double major. I am interested in exploring diverse fields across these 2 disciplines, ranging from AI / ML to concurrency and parallel computing, and as well as market making and derivatives trading. 

I'm willing to try exploring new opportunities out of my comfort zone, to go the extra mile to chase my dreams. This coming year, I plan to create my own startup to leverage the skills and knowledge I have to make a difference to the world. 

In my own personal time, I am an avid avant-garde fashion hobbyist, and someday I hope to create my own brand centered around sustainable fashion. I am also an avid sportsperson and mindfulness practitioner, as I believe the key to a good life is a balanced one. Drop me an email if you wish to connect!
